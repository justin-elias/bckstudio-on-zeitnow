                        BCK is joining the community in limiting the spread of COVID-19
                        Ashleah and Heather have been puzzling through some unique problems that come with limiting exposure to COVID-19 in the studio. Here are some of our precautions other than stepping up our regular disinfecting and asking everyone to regularly and properly wash hands and avoid touching your faces.

                        Our events bring in individuals who would not typically be spending time together; this is contrary to social isolation that is mandated. If you would like to book private time for your family or group of no more than 6, give us a call, and we will book time for you to be in the studio.

                    <Typography variant={"body1"} component={"p"}>
                        We have worked out a system for people to work in studio in very small groups that provides a 6' clearance from each other. The studio will stay open for members; however, we recommend calling ahead to make sure we keep numbers of people in the studio at one time six or less.

                        It turns out COVID-19 can survive ~10 days on surfaces! This means our Wonderful wedging tables need to be disinfected regularly, but with the shortage of isopropyl alcohol, we don't have a disinfectant that won't destroy the cement. Here's our work around. There will be heavy-duty plastic available to place over your work space and Lysol disinfectant for cleaning. We will spray down plastic on our tables with disinfectant after every customer and regularly throughout the day.

                    <Typography variant={"body1"} component={"p"}>
                        Wedging on plastic is rough! Also, sharing wedging boards could still introduce other people's germs into your clay. So, for those who don't want to brave what's in our porous tables, we will take orders for the creation of personal wedging boards. These boards will be 18" square wood covered in canvas. Lightweight and reasonably sized, they can be washed in the sink and sanitized. We would expect our potters to take them home to limit exposure while they are not in the studio. We are hoping same day/next day turn around on making and delivering these boards to the studio.
