                            Thank you for being interested in our Classes and Encounters! We want to make ceramics,
                            pottery and clay an affordable, entertaining past time for everyone. Here is a quick
                            guide to help you understand how our system works: Memberships keep us open and allow our
                            members to have access to the studio and equipment. Classes, on the other hand, directly
                            support local, working artists! During regular open studio hours, Ashleah and Heather
                            are available to meet the individualized needs of members. For more advanced ceramicists
                            and individuals that want access outside of these hours, we have memberships that grant
                            access to facilities up to 24/7. After hours, Artists rent the entire studio to teach
                            their own classes. Read on to find the option that speaks to you!
