      "artistStatement": "Megan Sprenger received her Master of Fine Arts from Montana State University in 2019. She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Studio Art with an emphasis in ceramics and sculpture from the University of Minnesota Duluth in 2016. Her work is inspired by her love for traveling, combined with the history of ceramics and the progression of sciences. She interweaves psychology, biology, and urban planning philosophies into her work. The use of historical ideology within ceramics and architectural and city planning is incorporated to introduce a more modern theme and encourage on a conversation between the ceramic vessel and the viewer. The imagery and surface details exemplify disorders, more precisely as the small particles of matter that change our perceptions within a variety of situations. These situations come across in the ways that the space we live in creates a phenomenological atmosphere, ultimately mirroring our own subconscious development.",
      "bio": "Megan has been teaching art for the last three years. Her goals for her students are to step into a new tactile world where they can explore the use of ceramics through history, functionality, and expressions.\n Each student receives hands on time with Megan, as she breaks down the importance of ceramics as a material and its use in our daily lives.",
